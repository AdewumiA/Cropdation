# Crop Recommendation System with Web Integration

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the most suitable crop for a given farmland based on user input. The model is integrated with a web interface to provide real-time crop recommendations, making it accessible and user-friendly.

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model that predicts the optimal crop for farmland based on various input features.
- Achieve high accuracy and precision in the model's predictions.
- Create a user-friendly web interface to collect user input and display predictions.

## Techniques and Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Utilized techniques to analyze and visualize soil and weather datasets to identify trends and insights.
- **Feature Engineering & Data Cleaning:** Performed feature engineering and data cleaning to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Machine Learning:** Trained and fine-tuned a machine learning model, achieving over 95% accuracy and precision in crop prediction.
- **Web Development:** Developed a responsive web interface using HTML and CSS to allow users to input data and view predictions.

## Summary of Conclusions

The machine learning model effectively predicts the most suitable crop for farmland with high accuracy. The web interface enhances user experience by providing a seamless platform for users to input data and receive real-time predictions.
